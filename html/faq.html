              <b>When will my order be processed?</b>
              <p>
                Usually, the order processing starts according to the description of the purchased product, however, sometimes there might be delays up to 48 hours, but in case delay lasts longer, you will have the right to receive a refund in accordance to our rules.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Why cannot I get a free test?</b>
              <p>
                If you did not get a free test, it means that you either already received it once or you have a private profile and no profile picture.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>What if I entered incorrect data for the order?</b>
              <p>
                Please contact us using the contact form.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>What if I made an order for a private profile?</b>
              <p>
                We suggest you to enable private mode on your profile and contact us in order to process the order one more time or receive a refund.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>When is it impossible to fix a problem with an incorrect order?</b>
              <p>
                If your order was processed anyway despite its failure, for example, if you mistakenly enter a login that already exists.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>What can I do if I’ve lost my followers after some time?</b>
              <p>
                You should read the description in order to make sure there is a guarantee for this order and determine whether you are in the warranty period or not. If you are, then contact us and we will take care of the problem.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Why the order does not match the description?</b>
              <p>
                In regard to changes in the functioning of different services there might be some inconsistencies, so we will be grateful if you will help us to identify the problem, please contact us if you see one and we will try to correct this.

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Is the real time orders tracker in the lower left corner real?</b>
              <p>
                Yes, our system checks new orders and shows them constantly, you can also see your orders there :)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>What if I enter an incorrect email address?</b>
              <p>
                It's okay, but you won’t be able to receive a letter notifying about the order processing failure if there is one, or a response from the technical support.

            <li>
